#' @title Give permission to write settings on disk
#' @description In interactive mode, ask users for permission to create a 
#'  .sen2r settings directory, in which to store files required by the packages.
#'  The function can be used also in non-interactive mode by setting 
#'  `agree = TRUE`.
#'  The function has no effect if the directory already exists.
#' @param agree Logical: if TRUE, allow creating the hidden directory;
#'  if FALSE, do not allow it; if NA (default), the permission is asked to
#'  the user in interactive mode (in non-interactive mode, the permission is
#'  denied).
#' @return Logical: if TRUE, R was authorised saving in the directory;
#'  if FALSE, it was not and a temporary directory is being used.
