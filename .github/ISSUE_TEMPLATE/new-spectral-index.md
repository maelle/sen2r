Use this template if you need to compute a spectral index which is not included in {sen2r}, or if you encountered an error in the formula of an unvalidated index taken from http://www.indexdatabase.de/ .

**Index information**
<!-- Provide the index name (abbreviation and full name), together with the index reference (scientific manuscript or online resource). -->

**Formula**
<!-- Provide here the index formula, univocally referencing the Sentinel-2 band numbers (refer to https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/resolutions/spatial ). -->

**Target image**
<!-- Please attach a referenced raster example of the required index, computed with an external software, to be used to validate the provided formula. If not provided, you will be asked to test the new added index before including it in {sen2r} (no unverified indices will be added). -->
