Unfortunately the owner can no longer provide assistance for this package.
If you need to ask for help or make a question about {sen2r} functionalities,
refer to the package documentation first, 
and check if the topic was already addressed within closed issues.
Then, address remaining doubts to public forums like StackOverflow,
where other users could eventually provide useful ticks.
Any opened issues will be automatically closed, as well as reopened old issues 
will be ignored.
The following template instructions are kept for backwards compatibility.

<!--

IMPORTANT NOTE: the following template must not be deleted, but read and filled with the required information. Issues written without following the template will be marked as "malformed" and ignored.

Use this template if you need assistance running {sen2r} on your code (e.g., in case of errors which are not a bug / you are not sure if they are a bug), or if in doubt about which template you should use. Please use this method instead than sending private email to the authors.

Before opening a new issue please check if the problem was already been mentioned (if so but the found issue is closed, open a new issue citing the old task instead than reopening it).

Ensure that your {sen2r} version is update with the last CRAN version:
install.packages("sen2r")

Ensure that the installation / configuration was performed correctly (follow https://sen2r.ranghetti.info/articles/installation.html ).

Please take particular care with code reproducibility (follow indications provided in the template).

Due to the limited time available to address all the issues, the developer will preferentially address requests finalised to publish scientific works; in this case, please provide the required information in the template below.

NOTES ABOUT EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
1. Please note that the use of an external GDAL environment (required only to smooth / buffer a cloud mask, and optionally to compute spectral indices, RGB images and thumbnails) is no more supported: maintainers are not responsible in case of GDAL-related issues.
2. Sen2Cor can be launched from {sen2r}, but it is an independent software: in case of problems with it, ensure that this is related to {sen2r} and not to Sen2Cor before opening an issue.

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT NETIQUETTE
1. Please remember that {sen2r} is not a commercial tool, so the developer is not obliged to provide assistance: please be polite, be patient if developers will not answer you instantly and respect the Code of Conduct (https://sen2r.ranghetti.info/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.html)
2. Your are required to answer when details (generally outputs of R commands) are required, and to provide a feedback after opening an issue, even after solving your problem or if you are not yet interested in solving it. In the case of missing feedback, the developer reserve the right to ignore your future requests.
3. Tasks can be closed after 10 days of inactivity (you can reopen it if you need further help).
